# YouTube ReVanced for Android 6.0-7.1
An unofficial ReVanced Extended for YouTube 17.34.36.  
Based on inotia00's ReVanced Extended [v2.160.1](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/releases/tag/v2.160.1)

## Overview
The last YouTube app available on Android 6 or 7 is **17.34.36**, but the latest ReVanced and ReVanced Extended are not compatible with 17.34.36.

However, until ReVanced Extended **v2.160.1**, most of patches worked properly, even though they weren't officially supported.

So I forked RVX 2.160.1 and released this unofficial (yet another) ReVanced Patches for YouTube 17.34.36.  
I fixed some issues in 2.160.1 and backported some features (**including protobuf-spoof**) from the new version.

Also, I have successfully made ReVanced Manager work on Android 6.0-7.1.  
So you can build it as easily as regular ReVanced and without Termux!

> However, due to stability and performance issues, if you have another newer device, you may want to use it.  
>
> For this "revanced-patches-android6-7" I have confirmed that the patch completes successfully on my main smartphone (Snapdragon 410, 2GB RAM, Android 7.1.1), but it took **45 minutes** to complete.

This repositly uses [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/kitadai31/revanced-patches-android6-7/discussions).  
It can be used for questions, supports, announcements, etc.

## Todo
I would like to quit developing based on 2.160.1 and remake it based on the latest RVX. (for well maintainability🔧, updated translation🌍 and new features✨)

## I have skill issue...
Embarrassingly, I'm not very familiar with reverse engineering and also programming. (But I can read a little smali :D )  
So I can not create new patches by myself. All my modifing are marely copy and paste.

If anyone else is interested in developing a ReVanced Patches for YouTube 17.34.36 besides me, please don't hesitate to release it!  
If a more excellent ReVanced Patches for YouTube 17.34.36 is emerged, I will immediately stop releasing my one and introduce yours!

Also all contributions are welcomed!
